"\"'Twas a particularly brutal criminal, from what I understand. This was, of "

"\"You're looking for him, eh? From the tone of your voice, I'm betting it "

"Pharod of old. He's a slippery one, he is, and it'll be a time before we can "
"pin something on him. Problem is, only a fanatic like Vhailor'd scrag the "
"guy without even a shred of proof. That's all a long way of saying I don't "
