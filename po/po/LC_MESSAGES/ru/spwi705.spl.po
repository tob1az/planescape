"Few know the true terror of Baator, let alone the gruesome Fifth Layer. This "
"devastating spell summons the harshest cold and bitter ice of the Fifth "
"Layer of Baator, Stygia, to annihilate all enemies within range. As the "
"River Styx flows through the Stygian Ice, so it does in this spell as well. "
"Perhaps if the victims are strong enough to survive this devastation they "
"may live to tell others about the true terror... but the River Styx has a "
"tendency to make people forget. \n"
"\n"
"Ice from Stygia is summoned to crush all creatures within sight for 8-64 "
"pts. of ice damage, with no saving throw. Finally, all creatures must save "
"vs. spell or suffer confusion for 5-30 seconds due to the immediate contact "
"with the frozen, forgetful waters of the River Styx."
