"These daggers were once wielded by Shar, the Mage-slayer. Shar was an "
"assassin of some merit who decided to specialize in the 'removal' of mages "
"for large sums of gold. To further her goal she commissioned the creation of "
"these blades by the mage Thex Voorton. With her new weapons in hand she was "
"quite successful at her craft. \n"
"\n"
"Shar met her demise when she was hired to assassinate the very mage who "
"created the daggers. Much to her surprise the weapons failed to harm their "
"creator, Thex, nor did they grant Shar protection against his spells...\n"
