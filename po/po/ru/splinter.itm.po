"This is a dagger-shaped fragment of stone taken from the statue of "
"Gangroighydron. It bears a powerful enchantment -- each time someone is "
"stabbed by the splinter, they have a chance of being Cursed. It is most "
"likely that the fell curse trapped upon Gangroighydron's lips has soaked "
"into the very stone of his petrified form, and 'poisons' those the splinter "
"stabs with his malicious magic."
