"This spell blinds up to 100 hit points of creatures within a 15 ft. radius / "
"level of the caster from the specified target point. The blindness spreads "
"outwards from the center, affecting creatures with the lowest HP totals "
"first. Those with more than 100 HP are not affected. The spell effect's "
"duration depends on the number of HP affected: If 25 or fewer HP are "
"affected, then the blindness lasts for 160-400 seconds. If 26-50 HP are "
"affected, the blindness lasts for 80-200 seconds.  If 51-100 HP are "
"affected, the blindness lasts for 16-40 seconds. An individual creature "
"can't be partially affected: Unless all of its HP are affected, it is not "
"blind."
