"This thin bladed sword is especially light. Despite its light weight, it "
"looks sharp enough to cut through most armor, especially when Dak'kon puts "
"his strength behind it. \n"
"\n"
"You can't tell for certain, but it seems as if the blade is alternately "
"shorter and longer than you recall. Any differences are so slight it is "
"difficult to be sure. Dak'kon has not commented on this.\n"
"\n"
"This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He "
"has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear "
"to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.\n"

"On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a "
"rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of "
"will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. \n"
"\n"
"A substance called \"karach\" is a material that can be shaped with the "
"mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental "
"discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He can shape "
"it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the "
"edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to manipulate the blade "
"in new ways. \n"
"\n"
"It is not known whether all githzerai zerth carry such weapons. Certainly a "
"weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only "
"to those who had learned to discipline themselves.\n"
