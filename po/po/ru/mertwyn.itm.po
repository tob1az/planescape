"This sturdy steel box has a thick leather handle on the top, but there's no "
"apparent way to open the thing - it appears to be welded shut. There are a "
"number of very narrow slits along one side, though you can't quite see into "
"the box through them. A sickly-sweet, rotting smell wafts out from the "
"slits.\n"
