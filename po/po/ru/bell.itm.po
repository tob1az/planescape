"The engravings on this bracelet are nothing short of beautiful. The "
"craftsmanship reflects the skilled work of the Meh 'gahmi Sah 'ma nomadic "
"tribes. This bracelet was carved for their greatest warrior-priestess, Bell, "
"who sought to bring peace to the greater southern plains region. The "
"enthralling purple stones inset along the bracelet give off a soft, warm, "
"royal purple glow."
