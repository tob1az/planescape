"This tattoo recognizes your mastery of the art of opening locks, so much so "
"that you may touch any lock once per day and open it *without* resorting to "
"lockpicks. This ability goes beyond just opening the lock, however; when you "
"invoke the tattoo's power, you gain an insight into the workings of the lock "
"you open, giving you a small experience point bonus as well. \n"
"\n"
"When the Knock ability is used up, the tattoo vanishes. "
