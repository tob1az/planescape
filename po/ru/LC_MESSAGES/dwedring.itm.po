"Among the many secrets of the Society of Sensation is the ability to shape a "
"peculiar stone from Elysium, dubbed \"soulstone.\" While this stone is not "
"as powerful as the sensory stones, the soul stone is said to carry an "
"imprint of the shaper's feelings. These rings are often used in Sensate "
"marriage ceremonies, each ring inscribed with the feelings of the other. "
"This ring was obviously intended for you.\n"
"\n"
"When wearing Deionarra's ring, you gain added protection from all attacks, "
"and additional protection from any piercing attacks... presumably, the "
"ring's purpose is to shield the heart from shock and trauma, and this "
"extends to any physical pain the wearer suffers as well.\n"
