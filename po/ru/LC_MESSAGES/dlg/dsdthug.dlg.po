"This wild-eyed man is hunched over, barking and howling at the top of his "
"lungs. Beneath his thick, matted hair, you can make out a series of strange "
"tattoos... they run the range from screaming faces, to bizarre geometric "
"shapes, to what appear to be lines of verse. He is almost naked, but the "
"dirt and filth covering him gives him the semblance of modesty."
